                    off of our bed or when we imagined that scary monster in our closet.</p>
                  <p> Regular night lights, or leaving the door open with the hall light on, was a quick fix. But kids also want
                    something to snuggle with. That’s why Starry Belly created their ingenious Dream Lites. </p>
                  <pStar Belly Dream Lites are the most huggable night lights that transform any dark, scary room into a
                  calming starry night sky! Just press the button on the belly and it will project a starry sky on the ceiling!
                  Perfect illumination that will calm your child so they can get the rest they need.</p>
